 <!-- Bio -->
 <p>
  Hingle McCringleberry played for Penn State University and Won A Heisman Trophy in 2012 also Won A National Championship.</p>

 <p> Once he graduated, the rookie was picked up by the Rhinos. He has come under fire lately over his excessive celebration. His signature 3 pump touchdown dance has been labeled illegal and will give McCringleberry an excessive celebration if he attempts it. After falling out of favor with the Rhinos, he was traded to the Portland Tigers for Ozamataz Buckshank, All-Pro defensive end and esteemed punter and legendary rap guru Dan Smith.
